This repository contains implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe, designed to showcase C++ programming concepts. The game is played on a 3x3 grid where two players take turns marking the spaces in a grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. This project is excellent for beginners looking to understand basic C++ syntax, conditional logic, loops, and functions.

Playable on the command line
Two-player game (no computer AI)
Simple and intuitive text-based user interface
